# Badger-Priorities
## What is it?
So it's just a priority cooldown script... I know what you're thinking. This is already a thing, it's already made! Well actually I found problems with the ones I found on the Fivem forums, so I decided to make a new one with some extra features. Another feature is that when the cooldowns are on (priority in progress, priorities on hold, or cooldown is above 0), then a message will be displayed to players driving a car 80 MPH or faster. This can be disabled in the configuration file too if you don't want this feature though.
## Commands
`/cooldown <time>` Sets the amount of time priority cooldown is on (minutes) 

`/inprogress` Sets the priority to in progress. Use this when a priority begins. 

`/onhold` This puts all priorities on hold. It is an alternative to PeaceTime except players are able to attack others. 

`/resetpcd` Changes Priority Cooldown back to 0 Minutes.
